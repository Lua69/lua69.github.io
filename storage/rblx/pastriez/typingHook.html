        <h1>So, here I am again talking about another bug because of a group of exploiters crashing the pastriez servers over and over again,</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Before I start talking about this bug I would like to say that,</p>
        <p>When I talked about the last bug I forgot to mention that you have to add a extra line,</p>
        <pre>nameTag.Adornee = plr.Character.Head</pre>
        <p>We need to add this line to prevent the players nametag getting stuck in their head.</p>
        <p>Here's a visual example: </p>
        <img src="./images/nametag-stuck.png" alt="nametag-stuck">
        <p>Ok, back to the main topic.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Before I start this bug may not patch them crashing the servers, but I know what my next step will be.</p>
        <p>So you probably remember this feature you added to your game, but later decided to remove it..</p>
        <p>Here's a visual example:</p>
        <img src="./images/typingHook - example.png" alt="typingHook-example">
        <p>Now, what's the problem about this?</p>
        <p>1. I can access it,</p>
        <p>2. It's replicating on the server,</p>
        <p>And last but not least,</p>
        <h1>I can spam-create it like the nametag bug!</h1>
        <h2>Here's a video of me spam creating it! :hehehehe:</h2>
        <video src="./videos/typingHook spam.mp4" controls></video>
        <h1>Finally, you might be like what remote is this? I don't remember.</h1>
        <p>Well's heres the simple handy dandy crash script.</p>
            <pre>for _ = 1, 10000 do
   game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").TypingHook:FireServer(true)
end</pre>

        <h2>That's all for this page, why did I make a website?</h2>
        <h1>Well that's so I can have more space to upload things!</h1>
        <h1>And have these cool themes,</h1>
        <h1>With the ability to put images in certain places, instead of at the both of the discord message.</h1>
        <hr>
        <h1>Your still here wondering who asked for this?</h1>
        <h1>Idk probably the whole pastriez discord server :skull:</h1>
        <h1>And someone directly in my dms.</h1>
